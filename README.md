**# Jar of Awesome**

Jar of Awesome is an idea inspired by the Tim Ferriss podcast. The goal of the app is to inspire you with your own story. The idea is that you would fill a jar with slips of paper, writing one every time something awesome happens. So when you are feeling down and needing a boost, you can pick one up at random.
